**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** Pre-Implementation Analysis

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Tropicam Voyage website is a React/TypeScript SPA built with Vite. It has a solid foundation with good component structure, but requires significant enhancements to become the #1 travel agency website in Morocco. The site currently focuses on Turkey, Dubai, and Omra, but lacks comprehensive Morocco-specific content and many conversion optimization features.

**Overall Grade: B- (70/100)**
